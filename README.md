# Metaverso Hackathon
## defn(life()) - Neo San Juan Submission

## Inspiration

I'm normally not interested in solar punk, but the challenge really made my creativity flow and rack my brain as to what could fit within PR.

## What it does

It's an animation loop made with Aseprite and music composed in Renoise.

## How we built it

1. Aseprite - Pixel Art. 
2. Renoise - Recording. 
3. Elektron Model:Samples - All drums and samples. 
4. Elektron Digitone Synthesizer - Bell Arpeggios, bass and chords.

## Challenges we ran into

Figuring out what worked from a pixel perspective. 

This originally was going to be a generative art piece using p5js and sound made by sending Orca or Pure Data midi notes to external synthesizers, but the time crunch got the better of me.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Although I played around with generative music and ended up using a composition, I'm proud of being challenged.

## What we learned

1. Art can be harder than sound design.
2. A lot of prep work is needed to make sure all the systems are working together, specially if you've changed to a different OS. 

## What's next for Neo San Juan

    Next is to keep exploring the chip and lo-fi ASCII aesthetic with a clearer goal in mind
    Begin introducing generative elements in music and art to the series via Pure Data / Gem, ORCA, etc.
